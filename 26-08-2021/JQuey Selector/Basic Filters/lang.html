    <h2> It is an example of jQuery :lang() selector. </h2>
    <p>
        The :lang() selector is used to select the elements with the specified language code. It selects the elements
        whose language value is equal to the supplied language code. This selector can also select the elements whose
        language value starts with the supplied language immediately followed by a hyphen ("-"). We can use the lang
        attribute in HTML to determine the language value of the elements.
    </p>
    <p lang="en"> This is first paragraph with lang = "en". </p>
    <p lang="fr"> This is second paragraph with lang = "fr". </p>
    <p lang="en-us"> This is third paragraph with lang = "en-us". </p>
    <div lang="es-es"> This is fourth paragraph with lang = "es-es". </div>
